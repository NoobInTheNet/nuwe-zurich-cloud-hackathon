# AWS Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform

This Terraform project automates the deployment of an AWS infrastructure for a web application that allows users to upload images to an S3 bucket. The infrastructure includes an S3 bucket, an API Gateway with a Lambda function, and a CloudFront distribution for serving the web application.

The web application frontend is served through a CloudFront distribution, which acts as a CDN for improved performance and scalability. The CloudFront distribution is backed by an API Gateway endpoint that triggers a Lambda function. The Lambda function handles the file upload logic and stores the images in an S3 bucket.

## Architecture Overview

The infrastructure is designed to provide a scalable and secure solution for image uploads. Here's an overview of the architecture:

![Architecture Diagram](diagrams/architecture.png)

The web application frontend is served through a CloudFront distribution, which acts as a CDN for improved performance and scalability. The CloudFront distribution is backed by an API Gateway endpoint that triggers a Lambda function. The Lambda function handles the file upload logic and stores the images in an S3 bucket.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```sh
my-terraform-project/
|-- main.tf
|-- backend.tf
|-- providers.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- outputs.tf
|-- versions.tf
|-- modules/
| |-- s3/
| | |-- main.tf
| | |-- variables.tf
| | |-- outputs.tf
| |-- api_gateway/
| | |-- main.tf
| | |-- variables.tf
| | |-- outputs.tf
| |-- lambda/
| | |-- main.tf
| | |-- variables.tf
| | |-- outputs.tf
| | |-- lambda_function/
| | | |-- main.py
| | | |-- requirements.txt
```

The root directory contains the main Terraform configuration files (`main.tf`, `backend.tf`, `providers.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, and `versions.tf`). The `modules/` directory contains the individual module configurations for the S3 bucket, API Gateway, and Lambda function.

## Infrastructure Decisions

### S3 Bucket

The S3 bucket is used to store the uploaded images. It provides durable and scalable storage with high availability. The decision to use S3 for storing the images ensures reliable storage and easy access.

### API Gateway

API Gateway serves as the entry point for the web application. It provides a secure and scalable API endpoint that triggers the Lambda function upon receiving requests. API Gateway integrates with CloudFront for improved performance and provides fine-grained control over access and throttling.

### Lambda Function

The Lambda function handles the file upload logic. Upon receiving a request from API Gateway, it extracts the uploaded file and stores it in the S3 bucket. The Lambda function is written in Python, making it easy to handle file operations and integrate with AWS services. Python also provides a lightweight runtime for quick execution and cost efficiency.

### CloudFront

CloudFront acts as a content delivery network (CDN) for the web application. It caches the frontend assets and provides faster content delivery to end-users. By caching the static files, CloudFront reduces the load on the backend and improves overall performance.

## Efficiency and Optimization

The chosen infrastructure design offers several benefits in terms of efficiency and cost optimization:

- Scalability: The use of AWS services like S3, API Gateway, and Lambda allows the infrastructure to scale based on demand. These services are highly scalable and can handle increased traffic and storage requirements.

- Cost Efficiency: The pay-as-you-go pricing model of AWS services ensures cost efficiency. With serverless architecture using Lambda, you only pay for the actual usage of the function, which optimizes costs for sporadic image uploads. The use of CloudFront and S3's cost-effective storage also contributes to cost optimization.

- Performance: The combination of CloudFront and API Gateway ensures faster content delivery and reduced latency. CloudFront caches the static assets, reducing the load on the backend and improving overall performance for end-users.

## Getting Started

To deploy the infrastructure using Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Install Terraform on your local machine.

2. Clone this repository to your local environment.

3. Navigate to the project root directory.

4. Initialize Terraform by running `terraform init`.

5. Adjust the variables in `terraform.tfvars` or provide them as environment variables.

6. Review the Terraform plan by running `terraform plan`.

7. Deploy the infrastructure by running `terraform apply`.

8. Confirm the deployment by typing "yes" when prompted.

9. Terraform will create the AWS resources based on the configuration.

10. Once the deployment is complete, the CloudFront distribution endpoint will be displayed in the output.
